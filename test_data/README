If you want to be able to run the query scripts, do the following:

1) Install the haskell cabal.
   In ubuntu this is "sudo apt-get install cabal-install"

2) Install cabal-dev. Since you have cabal you can do "cabal install cabal-dev"

3) cd query_scripts ; cabal-dev install

You will now find all the query script binaries in query_scripts/cabal-dev/bin/

4) create a databse in $USERNAME.db and run the SQL at the end of this file to create your tables.

5) Use query_scripts/cabal-dev/bin/add_test_cases to add the test cases you're interested in to your database. One option would be:

  cd ~/Documents/jscert/src/core/trunk/ ;
  test_data/query_scripts/cabal-dev/bin/add_test_cases `find tests/ -type f -name \*.js`

6) Run the runtests.py script with the --dbsave option to save the results of your test run.

7) cd test_data/query_scripts and run whatever queries you want to run :)

========================================================
This file will shortly contain useful instructions for how to use our
results databases to answer interseting questions about the behaviour
various JS implementations.

For now, it just contains notes about what tools gds is using to
build those databases.

I'm using ghc 7.6.2 and cabal.

I depend on HDBC, and when I did cabal install HDBC, I got HDBC-2.3.1.2

sudo aptitude install libsqlite3-dev

cabal install haskelldb-hdbc-sqlite3

cabal install hastache

cabal install cmdargs

cabal install regex-pcre
